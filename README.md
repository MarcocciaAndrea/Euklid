# EUKLID AI Systematic Trading Challenge

**Team Members:** Andrea Marcoccia, Leonardo Pulicati, Francesco Del Treste

## [Section 1] Introduction

The project aims to design and develop an AI-driven systematic trading model that can navigate the intricacies of financial markets with precision and agility. By harnessing the power of this dataset, the model will identify patterns, predict market movements, and execute trades to capitalize on these insights, all while managing risk and maximizing returns.

The datasets include 3 indices and 3 stocks: S&P500, Nasdaq, CAC, Microsoft, IBM, and Amazon, with the following data:

- **Date/Time Stamp:** Each record is associated with a specific week, allowing for temporal analysis of financial metrics over time.
- **OHLC Prices:** Provides the opening price, highest price, lowest price, and closing price of a stock or index for the week, crucial for understanding market trends and volatility.
- **Volume:** Indicates the total number of shares or contracts traded for the stock or index during the week, reflecting the level of activity and liquidity.
